## 🧠 How It Works
1. **Upload PDFs**  
   Users upload PDFs through the sidebar. 📂
2. **Text Extraction**  
   PyPDF2 extracts raw text from each page of the uploaded PDFs. 🔍
3. **Chunk Splitting**  
   Text is broken down using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` based on document size. 🧩
4. **Vector Embedding**  
   Chunks are converted to vector embeddings via a pre-trained HuggingFace model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`). 🔢
5. **FAISS Vector Store**  
   The embedded chunks are stored locally using FAISS for efficient retrieval. 💾
6. **Question Input**  
   Users ask questions based on the uploaded documents. ❓
7. **Contextual Retrieval**  
   FAISS fetches the top relevant document chunks using semantic similarity. 🏃‍♂️
8. **Answer Generation**  
   Retrieved context is passed into the selected Groq LLM using a custom prompt for answering. 🧑‍🏫
9. **Streaming Results**  
   Answers are displayed back in real time on Streamlit. ⏱️

## 🛠️ Customization

- **Add New Groq Models**  
  Update the `AVAILABLE_MODELS` list in `app.py` with new model names. ⚙️
- **Change Embedding Models**  
  Modify the `get_embeddings()` function to swap in different Sentence Transformer models. 🔄
- **Tune Prompt Templates**  
  Edit the `prompt_template` inside `make_qa_chain()` to guide Groq LLMs differently. ✍️
- **Adjust Chunk Size Logic**  
  Tweak `compute_chunk_size()` if you want different splitting heuristics based on your dataset. 🧳
  
## 📊 Performance Considerations
- **Chunk Size Tuning**  
  Large chunks may result in slower search but better context for answers. ⏳
- **Batch Inference**  
  Consider batching multiple user queries if scaling is needed. 🗂️
- **GPU Deployment**  
  If you embed very large PDFs, running on GPU machines speeds up HuggingFace models. 🖥️💨
- **Memory Management**  
  FAISS saves indexes locally, enabling persistence between runs. 💾
- **Scaling Streamlit**  
  Deploy Streamlit via services like Streamlit Sharing, AWS EC2, or Hugging Face Spaces for multi-user access. 🌍
